##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **modern analytics pipeline** for an e-commerce company (‚ÄúTheLook / Milo Store‚Äù).  
It shows how raw transactional data from multiple sources can be modeled, tested, and visualized to help executives answer key business questions such as:

- Where are we **losing potential revenue** in the funnel?  
- Which **products, countries, and customer segments** drive sustainable growth?  
- How do **returns, cancellations, and margins** affect profitability?  
- What are the **marketing conversion rates** across traffic sources and devices?

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance

As this project models user-level and behavioral data (sessions, purchases, and funnel events), it follows **GDPR-aligned data handling principles** used by EU analytics teams:

- **Data Minimization:** Only analytics-relevant attributes are modeled in dbt; personally identifiable information (PII) such as emails, addresses, and full names are excluded from Power BI outputs.
- **Pseudonymization:** User identifiers (`user_id`) are stored as surrogate keys (`customer_sk`) to prevent direct identification.
- **Purpose Limitation:** Data is processed exclusively for aggregated analytics, growth measurement, and marketing funnel optimization ‚Äî not for profiling or direct marketing.
- **Access Management:** The architecture separates *RAW ‚Üí STAGING ‚Üí MARTS* layers, ensuring only anonymized, aggregated marts feed executive dashboards.
- **Right to Erasure & Access:** The schema supports easy deletion or retrieval of user data through `user_id` traceability from marts back to raw.

By incorporating these principles, the project demonstrates how **modern analytics pipelines** can remain **compliant with EU GDPR** while still providing full-funnel visibility and actionable insights.
